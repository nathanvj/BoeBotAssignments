			<p>While there is no denying that the marble is the king of natural stones and looks stunning, the market today is flooded with better, cheaper choices.</p>
<p>Home owners increasingly are opting for affordable alternatives to <a href="https://www.mkwsurfaces.co.uk/stone/marble/natural-marble/">marble worktops</a>, in the form of engineered stone, made up of a small amount of quartz mixed with a binder.</p>
<p>Quartz countertops typically comprise 90%-93% natural ground quartz (a hard mineral) and approximately 7-10% resins, polymers, and pigments.</p>
<p>Quartz stone’s appearance varies from coarsely ground quartz offering a flecked appearance, while finely ground quartz offers a smooth look.</p>
<p>The results look like marble but are sturdier. Quartz can provide a marble-effect, on a more durable surface.</p>
<p>Natural stones like the marble and granite are not only unique, but they also may they require maintenance.</p>
<p>If you are on a lookout for hassle-free <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/marble-alternatives-057d4712">stunning looking worktops</a>, that are practically maintenance free, consider quartz.</p>
<div id="attachment_171" style="width: 830px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171" class="size-full wp-image-171" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Marble-Stone-Worktop-Closeup.jpg" alt="Marble Stone Worktop Closeup" width="820" height="330" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Marble-Stone-Worktop-Closeup.jpg 820w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Marble-Stone-Worktop-Closeup-300x121.jpg 300w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Marble-Stone-Worktop-Closeup-768x309.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /><p id="caption-attachment-171" class="wp-caption-text">Close-up image of an Opal Calacatta Gold worktop surface</p></div>
<p>Quartz does not stain and scratch easily, unlike natural stone. Quartz countertops can offer a clean minimalistic look, as well as looks with veining.</p>
<p>As early as 1963, Breton, an Italian company developed the technology of creating engineered stone/Quartz.</p>
<p>Over the last 50 plus years, it has licensed the usage of this marvellous technology to over 50 companies around the world, carefully ensuring there is only one quartz manufacturer on each country.</p>
<p>With this intention, Cosentino (who makes Silestone) produces quartz in Spain, Compac Quartz makes their slabs in Portugal, Caesarstone in Israel and so on.</p>
<p>Having an exclusive quartz manufacturer per country ensures the result of the slabs are manufactured perfectly and under strict guidelines.</p>
<p>The different manufacturers add their own flair and aesthetic enhancers to their engineered stone counter-tops, creating some delightful pieces.</p>
<p>Despite the brand you chose, the composition, hardness, water absorption statistics, heat resistance and other functional properties remain the approximately same.</p>
<p>What differs from one quartz brand to another is:</p>
<h2>Designs</h2>
<p>The range of designs is the single biggest difference between quartz manufacturers.</p>
<p>The slab&#8217;s visual appeal, the colour, size, shape, and striations vary from one brand to another.</p>
<p>Since the look of the stone changes based on brands, the selection requires careful observation.</p>
<h2>Slab Sizes</h2>
<p>The sizes of the slab vary per the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Check the details before selecting the ones that best fit your requirements.</p>
<p>Whereas during the last 20 years the average slab size covered an average 4.27 m2, the advent of larger stones has resulted in an increase of the average quartz slab sizes to 5.16 m2.</p>
<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>Quartz slab prices are wholesale-only and are confined to the supply chain between manufacturer and approved dealers.</p>
<p>While one cannot directly negotiate with the manufacturers, it is advised to speak to a few dealers and opt for the best offers.</p>
<p>This is so, because rather than just buying a quartz slab, people also require carrying out labour on the material which differs in its characteristics.</p>
<p>Some of the largest quartz manufacturers in the world are:</p>
<h2>Cambria</h2>
<p>Minnesota based; the company is the only American company in the quartz surfaces business.</p>
<p>Operating since 2000, the company is relatively new but offers a vivid selection of designs, colours, edges, and slab sizes.</p>
<p>Cambria Quartz is distinctive in that it is family-owned.</p>
<p>With a background on food processing, Cambria slabs are made with the highest degree of quality and with superior artistry.</p>
<p>Not only that Cambria uses its own quartz quarries to make their slabs, but the quality control of the material is second to none.</p>
<p>It results in stunning surfaces that are unparalleled by others when it comes to attention to detail.</p>

<h2>Caesarstone</h2>
<p>The company calls itself &#8220;original&#8221; manufacturer of quartz countertop material and this Israel based company has been in the business since 1987.</p>
<p>The Israel based company, was the first manufacturer to produce engineered quartz slabs for the market.</p>
<p>Before it, most companies were producing composite marbles.</p>
<p>It is this innovative approach and the constant search for new products, that made Caesarstone of the largest quartz makers worldwide.</p>
<p>Not only that the brand boasts trusted network on all continents, but it is also listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.</p>

<h2><strong>Make an Impact with your Images</strong></h2>

<p>The impact that images and pictures have on your target audience is the drive to get them to click on your product.</p>
<p>Make use of images on your blogging sections on your website, or you can use image based social media sites such as Instagram, Tumblr, and Exposure to share and increase your brand awareness.</p>
<h2><strong>Repurpose Old Content</strong></h2>
<p>If done the right way, repurposing content is a great way to help marketers save time as well as expand their brand reach.</p>
<p>Instead of constantly creating new contents for the same group of audience, try picking out key details form your previously published content and repost them to your social channels to reach out to more people.</p>
<p>In addition to resharing your old content on your social media platforms, you can also try adapting your content in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>For example, you can change your visual content and publish them as articles and share them on social platforms such as Slideshare.</p>
<h2><strong>Incorporate Video into your Content</strong></h2>
<p>In digital platforms, <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-visual-content-online/">almost everything is visual</a>, which is why incorporating and sharing video content will help your brand stand out in the market.</p>
<p>This will help you connect with your target audience and followers on a personal level.</p>
<p>Create customer testimonies, product presentations or trainings to reach to your audience in different ways.</p>
<p>The good news is, even when you don’t have any skills, with the help of social media video and editing tools, you are able to create high quality videos that are appealing to your audience.</p>
<h2><strong>Focus on Top Performing Platforms</strong></h2>
<p>To help you improve your productivity on social media, you need to focus more on social networking channels that provide your brand with highest return on investment.</p>
<p>Know what is working for you as well as what is not.</p>
<p>For starters, you can begin by analyzing your social media platforms, then proceed to compare their overall performance.</p>
<p>Use social media analytic tools such as buffer, Social Sprout, Hootsuite among others to help you gather more data and information.</p>
<p>The collected insights, will help you come up with a better marketing strategy so that you can dedicate your time and resources on social platforms that have high ROI.</p>
<h2><strong>Never Stop Learning</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to succeed in digital marketing, you need to be an expert in as many social media topics as possible.</p>
<p>As a marketer, being aware of the <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/2019-social-media-trends/286029/">latest marketing developments</a>as well what&#8217;s trending will give you an edge over other social media marketers in your niche.</p>
<p>As a social media manager, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be skilled in using variety of social media tools</li>
<li>Be able to manage social media campaigns especially paid ads</li>
<li>Be to able to understand how to use web analytics tools and social media metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also advisable to continue improving your skills in different areas such as copywriting, marketing, data analytics, presentation, design as well as communication.</p>
<h2><strong>Outsource</strong></h2>
<p>Large organizations usually have a team of specialists based in different locations to carry out their marketing strategies outside their agencies.</p>
<p>Outsourcing social media tasks help brands reduce the amount of time they spend on routine social media activities.</p>
<p>Outsourcing will help you boost your social media productivity.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of social media specialists, come with them lots of experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>These specialists can help your brand with all sorts of social media activities including monitoring your performance on social media, marketing as well as administration services.</p>
<h2><strong>Give Customers a Reason To Provide Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>Getting real customer feedback is extremely important for marketers.</p>
<p>Feedback helps businesses know the reaction of their customers to their product offerings.</p>
<p>It also provides a basis for engagement between brands and their followers to drive up sales.</p>
<p>Usability tests, surveys, and questions are some of the methods that brands use when they want to gather information from those who buy their products and services.</p>
<p>As a way of encouraging them to provide you with the feedback you’re looking for, try offering them certain incentives, e.g. discount coupons.</p>
<p>With a little persuasion, most customers would be willing to spare a minute and give you their honest insights into how they think you can improve the quality of your products.</p>

			<p>A condo which is the short form of the condominium is not as the same as buying a single-family home.</p>
<p>One must consider a lot of factors before purchasing the condo.</p>
<p>At times, the purchase of a condo in real estate market comes at a lower price than in the purchase of a single-family residence.</p>
<p>Typically, a condo is a shared piece of property where there exist individual owners of each condo or unit.</p>
<p>Quite often, condos offer many services that are not limited to pools, tennis courts and fitness centers among others.</p>
<p>Condos are known for their lifestyle of living as well as the less maintenance which makes many people buy them.</p>
<p>One must be aware of the fact that each condominium community is different from the others when buying a condo.</p>
<p>You should know that each community has its amenities, Management Company, association fees, and its own community rules.</p>
<p>The number of condo communities in a certain area depends on the community.</p>
<p>There may be hundreds of condos or even just a handful of them in a certain area.</p>
<p>Therefore, there exist many tips that you should be aware of before buying a condo investment property.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Real-Estate-Agent.jpg" alt="Real Estate Agent" width="602" height="401" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Real-Estate-Agent.jpg 602w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Real-Estate-Agent-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Real-Estate-Agent-570x380.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<h2>Check with an Experienced Realtor</h2>
<p>Since the sale of condos is different from the sale of vacant lands, multi-family or single family, it is very essential to <a href="https://perfectagent.com.au/">hire a real estate agent</a> experienced in the sale of condos.</p>
<p>This is because the purchase contract for a condo is different from that of the other residences.</p>
<p>One difference that exists in the sale of condos is that most communities require a deal to be signed before closure of the sale contract.</p>
<p>The agreement that you sign states that you clearly understand and agree to the rules and regulations stipulated by the association.</p>
<p>With the existence of such differences, working with an experienced condo selling agent is very relevant since the agent will easily guide you through the whole process and ensure that the most critical details are not overlooked.</p>
<h2>Check the Comps (Both Sale &amp; Rental) &amp; Calculate the Cap Rate</h2>
<p>Any Realtor with sense is bound to show you the comps of the property you are considering to buy if they do not have access to a new Realtor.</p>
<p>However, most of the Realtors do not possess enough know-how in analyzing the rental comps.</p>
<p>However, it is not a very sophisticated process.</p>
<p>Just review the condo docs very carefully.</p>
<p>Ask for the closed, pending and current rentals for the past six months if the agent you are dealing with is not specialized in the analysis.</p>
<p>This gives you a rough idea of <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-calculate-capitalization-rate-for-real-estate-2866786">what you expect in the rent</a> for your property. Through this, you can come up with an idea of what to offer for the purchase price.</p>
<p>You need to be as close as possible to the 10% Cap Rate. It is okay if it surpasses this Cap Rate but anything above 5% is okay in areas with the high market such as Florida.</p>
<p>The Cap Rate is calculated by taking the monthly net income, multiplying it by 12 and then dividing it by the purchase price.</p>
<h2>Know What the Condominium Includes</h2>
<p>The idea of knowing what is included in the condo sounds silly, but it is very relevant.</p>
<p>When you are purchasing a condo, it is relevant to know whether the condo has any additional storage or includes reserved parking.</p>
<p>Does the condo community offer any parking for your visitors? Is the spot reserved for parking in the covered garage?</p>
<p>An example of this is the recent condo sales in Rochester, NY where the seller had rented the parking spot to one of the members of the community.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the agreement between the two was not a long-term.</p>
<p>Thus, it could not have inconvenienced the buyer as such.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is relevant to make sure that the parking space, as well as the additional storage space, are available before purchasing the condo.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the property has or allows a washer and dryer.</p>
<p>This is an essential part of every home since you can always charge a monthly rent of $200 to $500 more if the condo has the washer and dryer in it.</p>
<p>People always pay premiums for such facilities but do not be discouraged if the washer and dryer are not in the condo you are interested in.</p>
<p>If it does not exist, you can always put it up to increase the bottom line.</p>
<h2>Talk to the Home Owners Association</h2>
<p>Having an in-depth <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2015/02/11/what-you-need-to-know-before-you-buy-into-a-condo-association/">talk with the association</a> is one of the most critical things that one should consider when purchasing a condo.</p>
<p>This helps you to know the number of association fees that you are supposed to pay.</p>
<p>Condo communities have annual, bi-annual, quarterly and monthly fees charged per residence.</p>
<p>Such association charges are used to cover for maintenance, insurance, and other common expenses. Therefore, being aware of these charges is essential.</p>
<p>Also, it helps one to be acquainted with the association rules.</p>
<p>Since every community has rules and regulations that govern it, the condo community rules and regulations are drafted and exercised by the condo association.</p>
<p>To ensure that you do not break these essential rules speaking to the association and reviewing their rules and regulations is very necessary.</p>
<p>For example, many condo communities do not allow pets.</p>
<p>The last thing that you would hate about the place is learning that the association does not allow pets in the community if you love having them around.</p>
<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/legal-restrictions-renting-your-home-airbnb-other-rental-services.html">being aware of the short-term rental restrictions </a>and if there are quiet hours.</p>
<p>This is essential especially to persons who had to put up with bad neighbors in their past residences and also for those who like the idea of renting their places of residence on a short-term basis.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should understand that the existence of the association rules is essential and that they are part of the condo community.</p>
<p>To make sure that this works out for you, make sure that you talk to the association and review their rules and regulations.</p>

			<h2>Earn Tax Free Income If You Work At Sea</h2>
<p>A great piece of legislation offered for seafaring United Kingdom employees came into effect as of the 1988 Finance Act that is not very well known but is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees/professional-fees-and-subscriptions">an excellent tax exemption</a> for those who qualify. As of 2012, this piece of legislation became a 100% tax exemption for those employed in foreign waters around the world. Many people who would be entitled to this great tax break do not know it or do not use it because it is not that very well known and the HMRC is incredibly vague. We will dedicate ourselves to helping you understand the Seafarers Earnings Deduction and whether or not you can benefit from it.</p>
<p>A long battle has occurred over 18 years between seafaring unions and the HMRC <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/41/contents">since the 1988 Finance Act was introduced</a> that allows certain United Kingdom citizens who work in the seafaring industry to keep 100% of their earned income but only if they meet certain criteria. This piece of legislation was put together in 1988 and only got to its current incarnation as of the 2012 Finance Act. Within this article, we intend to dive into the full details of the rules and regulations that govern the Seafarers Earning Deduction. It is an excellent resource for citizens of the UK who are employed on ships that embark and disembark in foreign countries. If you qualify for this tax exemption you will be able to keep all of your earnings. Not all seafarers are eligible for this tax deduction. We aim to educate and inform you within this article because the HMRC has kept this tax exemption elusive and secretive and we have decided it is time to shed light on this topic. Continue reading below to find out if you qualify and all the different intricacies that make this a valuable tax exemption.</p>
<div id="attachment_84" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84" class="aligncenter wp-image-87 size-full" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Magnifying-Glass-Looking-at-Wallet-Full-of-Money.jpg" alt="Magnifying Glass Looking at Wallet Full of Money" width="605" height="403" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Magnifying-Glass-Looking-at-Wallet-Full-of-Money.jpg 605w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Magnifying-Glass-Looking-at-Wallet-Full-of-Money-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Magnifying-Glass-Looking-at-Wallet-Full-of-Money-570x380.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /><p id="caption-attachment-84" class="wp-caption-text">Seafarers can now see their savings grow after paying no income taxes.

<p>First of all, as we stated briefly the HMRC does not provide much information about this tax law. The details they do provide is hard to understand and apply. To begin with, the Seafarers Earnings Deduction was created to help those employed in the seafaring industry to deal with the competitive global marketplace. This tax exemption was also created to provide a solution for the national defence needs of the The UK in foreign waters. Although national defence is one of the reasons for this tax break, unfortunately, those employed in the military that spend time in foreign waters are not able to take advantage of this exemption.</p>
<p>When one reads through the HMRC 205 Helpsheet it seems to be written in a foreign language that does not provide a lot of detail or information. What it does contain are certain rules that you must follow to qualify. The very first rule mentions that you must work on a ship. What qualifies as a ship is not explained however what a ship is not has been listed as follows, floating and fixed production platforms, mobile offshore drilling units, and flotels are not considered ships. If you work on one of these then, unfortunately, you will not be able to use<br />
the SED.</p>
<p>Some individuals will choose not to file their offshore earnings and may face penalties as well as investigation. As for other people they may choose to be more proactive and set up a limited company ashore or companies in foreign countries for tax reasons. If you choose to avoid filing your taxes you will suffer. It is worth harnessing the <a href="https://marineaccounts.com/seafarers-earnings-deduction.php"><strong>Seafarers Earnings Deduction</strong></a> if you are able. You really do not suffer when you don&#8217;t have to pay anything on your tax bill.</p>
<p>There are a few more requirements that you must adhere to in order to take advantage of this tax exemption. This includes that you <a href="https://www.expertsforexpats.com/answers/tax/how-long-do-you-have-to-stay-out-of-the-uk-to-avoid-paying-tax/">spend no longer than 183 days in the United Kingdom</a> within a given tax year. You will be required to have documentation and stubs that show how many days you spent ashore. A day ashore is considered when you are in the UK as of midnight that day that counts as a day ashore. You will need to have documentation in case you are investigated. Another rule is that you must embark or disembark from foreign ports. If you were to embark or disembark on your journey within the United Kingdom then you would not be able to take advantage of the Seafarers Earnings Deduction. You will also have to spend a certain amount of time outside of the United Kingdom to qualify. You can use Helpsheet 205 from the HMRC to get further details.</p>
<p>It is incredibly important that you file your annual tax return as you can declare all of your earned monies without having to pay taxes. If the HMRC would make this tax exemption more understandable then maybe more seafaring employees would take advantage of it. Filing your taxes is integral as the Open Exchange of Information can easily investigate you and penalise you. Without paying taxes you will not be able to do anything with your earned income including acquiring loans or mortgages. The Seafarers Earnings Deduction is a great tool for those that meet the criteria and should be harnessed by seafaring UK citizens.</p>

			<h2>Carports Keep Your Vehicles Safe, Secure &amp; Dry All Year Round</h2>
<p>Have you been thinking of purchasing a carport? Within this article, we will outline the positive attributes and benefits that a carport provides. We have listed the features they offer below and we will show you how a carport can create a safe, covered addition to your home to park your car as well as for <a href="http://www.southwest-builders.com/blog/can-the-right-carport-save-your-car-and-help-your-home-retain-value/">adding extra resale value to your home</a>. Continue reading below for all the benefits you will appreciate using a carport.</p>
<p>To begin with keeping your vehicle covered and protected from the elements will <a href="https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-prevent-sun-damage-car-paint.htm">protect it from weather damage such as paint fading</a> from the hot sun all the way to snow and hail damage in colder months. You can maintain the value of your vehicle even more so by harnessing the use of a carport.</p>
<p>Speaking of colder winter months, when your vehicle is protected by a carport, you will not have to spend the extra time during snowy and icy winters scraping ice off of your windshields and shovelling snow off of your entire vehicle. Think about how much time and frustration this will save you in the winter. You won&#8217;t have to spend the extra ten to fifteen minutes in the morning doing these undesirable tasks.</p>
<div id="attachment_74" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-74" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Small-Blue-Garden-Shed.jpg" alt="Small Blue Garden Shed" width="605" height="659" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Small-Blue-Garden-Shed.jpg 605w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Small-Blue-Garden-Shed-275x300.jpg 275w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Small-Blue-Garden-Shed-349x380.jpg 349w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /><p id="caption-attachment-74" class="wp-caption-text">There Are Some Stunning Carport Designs Available on the Market. Image credit: Houzz</p></div>
<p>Another added benefit of a carport is that they are cost-effective and inexpensive compared to a garage. They give your vehicle the protection it needs without the large expenses associated with building and using a garage. If you are on a budget but require the same protection from the weather for your vehicle at the fraction of the expense of a garage, a carport is your optimum solution.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of using timber carports is that they are not just for cars. You can store anything from motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, RV’s, trucks, boats, and trailers among other things. This will protect these items and give them the added protection of being parked beside the house rather than out down on the street. You can also use your carport space as a sheltered outdoor entertaining area where you can host events like BBQs and get-togethers with family and friends.</p>
<p>Your choices are unlimited with where you can position your carport, unlike a garage. You can place it anywhere you desire allowing that you can park your car under it. You can use it as an extension to the garage you already have or as an extension to your home as a covered outdoor entertaining area as well.</p>
<p>Another wonderful benefit of using a carport is the added safety that it offers. You can place it next to a front door so elderly or single homeowners do not have to travel far from their car to their front door. This gives the homeowner the added comfort and safety being much closer to their home and less vulnerable while getting in and out of their vehicles.</p>
<div id="attachment_75" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Constructing-a-Car-Port-Frame.jpg" alt="Constructing a Car Port Frame" width="605" height="454" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Constructing-a-Car-Port-Frame.jpg 605w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Constructing-a-Car-Port-Frame-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Constructing-a-Car-Port-Frame-506x380.jpg 506w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /><p id="caption-attachment-75" class="wp-caption-text">A Carport Can Be Erected in a Matter of Hours. Image credit: Donnies Home Services</p></div>
<p>The last feature we will address is that adding a carport can easily add home resale value to your property. Your prospective buyers will find your property more usable and attractive with a carport and when it comes to finding buyers installing a carport will act as an added incentive for buyers looking to purchase your home.</p>
<p>There are many different options available when it comes to purchasing or building a carport. We suggest that prior to going ahead with installing a carport that you <a href="http://www.milwoodgroup.com/do-i-need-planning-permission-for-a-carport/">check with your local authority regarding planning permission</a> beforehand so you are not left disappointed. There are two options when it comes to installing a carport. You can build one yourself or you can purchase a prefabricated unit. Ideally, you want your carport to blend in with the architecture of your home and choosing a design and colour scheme that highlights your home will be best. It is suggested that you browse the internet and look at the different options available for your home. They can be built from almost anything including materials such as brick, wood, and aluminium.</p>
<p>The added comfort that a carport offers is second to none and it is much less costly than building a garage. When it comes to building a garage you will generally have to follow municipal laws and hire contractors which is costly. Another thing about garages is that they require a lot more material and space which could be a problem if you were to be on a budget. The last benefit that we will share with you of carports is the fact that you do not have to spend any extra money on electricity, unlike a garage. Overall you will appreciate a carport and if you are thinking of installing one now is the time to get started.</p>

			<h2>Get a Low-Cost Sleek &amp; Contemporary Workspace</h2>
<p>When it comes to running a business the success of your company is usually the biggest priority. However, there are other things that are necessary when it comes to success and that is how you use your office space. It is common for <a href="http://www.designcurial.com/news/office-design-the-best-and-worst-trends-4274580/">a lot of office interiors to lack style and design</a> features. Your office is the place where you do consultations and daily work with clients and employees and making your office space carry a distinct design and character are what we will discuss within this article. We will show you a few ways on how to make your workspace more visually appealing and comfortable.</p>
<p>We will discuss different methods to invent a new look and style for your office without spending a lot of money. You can make your office space look good so follow our suggestions for the best results. Having a warm and comfortable office is essential and decorating it with arrangements can make it that much cosier.</p>
<div id="attachment_64" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Colourful-Office-Breakout-Area.jpg" alt="Colourful Office Breakout Area" width="605" height="350" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Colourful-Office-Breakout-Area.jpg 605w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Colourful-Office-Breakout-Area-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /><p id="caption-attachment-64" class="wp-caption-text">Colour Plays a Massive Role in Changing Workplace Mood &amp; Atmosphere. Image credit: Azure Magazine</p></div>
<p>If your office feels boring and bland you can always <a href="https://www.landmarkplc.com/news-and-insights/freshen-your-workspace">freshen it up with splashes of colour</a>. Having certain colours featured throughout your room can alter the mood and feel of it. When it comes to picking a colour choosing within your company brand colours is ideal. The right tone of colours will also depend on what type of company and industry your business is within. For more creative companies, warmer colours are generally agreeable. Whereas when it comes to a lawyers office or a corporate setting, neutral tones like grey and blues are ideal. The colours of your office will reflect on both you and your company and will set the mood of the room.</p>
<p>Another thing you can always do is purchase accessories, chairs, and tables that reflect the colour scheme you are aiming for you in your workspace. They can make your office feel more comfortable and appealing when your furniture matches the colours and hues of your office.</p>
<p>When you are busy running a business one inevitable factor is that paperwork will pile up and within a short amount of time, it will clutter and take over your office. Knowing how to organise your paperwork is of the utmost importance and doing this will prevent a cluttered, messy office. We have a suggestion for managing the countless pieces of paper you deal with below.</p>
<p>We suggest that you <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/explore/2-drawer-file-cabinet/?lp=true">invest in a small filing cabinet</a> that can handle all of your important paperwork and files. Our best recommendation would be one that features wheels so you can roll it into place or easily tuck it away so you don&#8217;t bump into it. A filing cabinet on wheels makes the office that much more usable and clutter free.</p>
<div id="attachment_63" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Velcro-Headquarters-Reception-Area.jpg" alt="Velcro Headquarters Reception Area" width="605" height="404" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Velcro-Headquarters-Reception-Area.jpg 605w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Velcro-Headquarters-Reception-Area-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Velcro-Headquarters-Reception-Area-569x380.jpg 569w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /><p id="caption-attachment-63" class="wp-caption-text">Having a Stunning Reception Area Makes a Great First Impression. Image credit: Velcro</p></div>
<p>Our last featured suggestion is one that may be slightly controversial. It is now becoming a common trend for offices to do without reception areas, clearing up valuable space if you do not deal with a lot of clientele coming into your office. If you don&#8217;t have a lot of business coming to your office then consider removing the reception area. You will save money on the expensive rental space and you can use it for other things.</p>
<p>When it comes to your business, having a <a href="https://tcdconstruction.co.uk"><strong>stylish office interior design</strong></a> is the cornerstone and face of the company.</p>

			<h2>Maintaining an Environmentally Friendly Office</h2>
<p>One of the biggest trends that is popular these days is the belief of being environmentally friendly and <a href="https://www.innovation.ca/story/its-possible-take-green-approach-and-still-be-productive">taking a green approach to life</a>. As a society we are doing what we can to waste less and recycle more while trying to make choices that directly impact the environment in a positive way. One specific area that has improved greatly because of environmental consciousness is the value of <a href="http://eartheasy.com/live_nontoxic_solutions.htm">using natural products for cleaning</a>. We spend our entire lives inside our homes, apartments, schools, vehicles, offices, and all types of buildings. We typically are inside and when we are inside air quality is incredibly important. With this in mind our buildings need to be cleaned with natural products that will not cause our health harm. We don&#8217;t want to use chemicals or agents that can directly impact us, hurt us or the environment.</p>
<div id="attachment_57" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101" src="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Green-Plastic-Cleaning-Products.jpg" alt="Green Plastic Cleaning Products" width="605" height="378" srcset="http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Green-Plastic-Cleaning-Products.jpg 605w, http://www.abyz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Green-Plastic-Cleaning-Products-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /><p id="caption-attachment-57" class="wp-caption-text">Going Green Means Chemical Free, Not the Colour! Image credit: Greenily</p></div>
<p>Years ago cleaning your home would actually cause it to become a toxic mess. The cleaners of old were not good for us as they were petroleum based. They got the job done when it came to cleaning but also caused <a href="https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/how-toxic-are-your-household-cleaning-supplies">long term health damage to anyone exposed to the fumes or chemical</a>. Not too long ago chemical cleaning agents would give off fumes and leave residues. You would typically have to wear rubber gloves when applying the cleaners and you had to be sure not to breathe any of it in or else you would get hit with a headache or dizzy.</p>
<p>Thankfully nowadays it is common to find natural based cleaning agents at stores all over the world. They are becoming more popular because they do not use petroleum, they are created from renewable resources, they are biodegradable and are not toxic. There is a wide range of cleaning products that utilise natural ingredients. These include things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window cleaners, glass cleaners, mirror cleaners</li>
<li>General purpose cleaners and disinfectants</li>
<li>Tile and hard floor cleaners</li>
<li>Stain and carpet cleaners</li>
<li>Hand soap and paper products</li>
<li>Air fresheners</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are looking for cleaning products on the store shelves, we recommend you purchase items with that have the Green Seal Certification.

<p>Here is some advice provided below on how to find the best family law lawyer in your area:</p>
<h3>The First-Time Visit</h3>
<p>Are you interviewing a lawyer that has a full case load of family law matters and only does family law? Will he or she meet you outside of the office or after hours? Is there a fee incurred during your first visit?</p>
<h3>Past Cases</h3>
<p>When it comes to your first appointment, be sure you conduct it with the solicitor and not a junior member of staff as they can often miss out on critical and time-related concerns that may impact the results of your case. You will want to find an attorney who has years of experience with family law and a winning track record.</p>
<h3>Teamwork</h3>
<p>If your solicitor is temporarily unavailable you will want to find a lawyer who has a team available and qualified to assist you while they are away. You will want a team of lawyers at your disposal if necessary with high qualifications if your solicitor is unavailable.</p>
<h3>Are they Accredited with Independent Reviewers?</h3>
<p>Before you select a solicitor to handle your case find out if they are accredited in family law from any independent bodies from the area that is in charge of accreditation of law firms in your area.</p>
<h3>Can you Communicate Easily with your Solicitor?</h3>
<p>Life happens twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week. You may have questions and needs that need to be addressed outside of business hours. Be sure to find out if the solicitor you are selecting allows after-hours advice and consulting on your case as part of their service.</p>

<h3>How much will Court Representation cost?</h3>
<p>The fees and costs associated with representing you in court should be figured out and estimated before the case begins. You will be billed for things such as long distance phone calls, filing fees, investigators, long distance mileage and your lawyers expertise. You will want to agree upon a final price before your case comes to trial that both you and your attorney can agree with.</p>
<p>We suggest you <a href="https://worthingtons.uk.com"><strong>contact a family law solicitor</strong></a> that you feel ticks all of the above boxes and you feel comfortable with. Divorce and separation is a messy business so expect a bumpy ride along the way.</p>
